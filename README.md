# 🛡️ FaceGuard AI – Identity & Deepfake Protection

This project allows you to record or upload a face video, extract frames, crop real face images, and generate deepfake-style face swaps using [SimSwap](https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap) — all through a simple web UI powered by Gradio.

---

## 🚀 Features So Far

- 📹 Record or upload video via UI
- 🔼️ Extract frames from the video
- 👤 Crop and save face images
- 🧪 Generate deepfakes using SimSwap (via subprocess)
- 💻 Gradio-based UI, modular backend

## 📦 Setup

### Create and activate two environments:

#### 🟩 FaceGuard Env:
```bash
conda create -n faceguard python=3.9
conda activate faceguard
pip install -r requirements-faceguard.txt
```

#### 🟦 SimSwap Env:
```bash
conda create -n simswap python=3.9
conda activate simswap
pip install -r requirements-simswap.txt
```

> 💡 FFmpeg must be installed system-wide and available in your PATH.

## ▶️ How to Run

From the project root directory:

```bash
conda activate faceguard
python run_app.py
```

Then open your browser at:  
📍 `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

## 📂 Where Output Files Are Stored

| Output Type      | Location                             | Description                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 📹 Raw Videos     | `simswap_new/videos/<user>/`         | Original + re-encoded videos              |
| 🔼️ Extracted Frames | `frames/<user>/`                      | Every 5th frame from re-encoded video     |
| 👤 Real Faces     | `faces/<user>/real/`                 | Cropped faces detected from frames       |
| 🧪 Fake Faces     | `faces/<user>/fake/`                 | SimSwap-generated deepfake images        |

---

## ✅ Notes

- Only videos with `.mp4` extension are supported (auto-re-encoded).
- SimSwap runs in a separate subprocess using the `simswap` environment.
- Identity images for face swaps should be placed in:
  ```
  simswap_new/utils/faceswap_identities/
  ```

### 💾 Required Model Downloads

Make sure the following model files are downloaded and placed in the correct locations:

1. **SimSwap Pretrained Models**  
   Download from this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jV6_0FIMPC53FZ2HzZNJZGMe55bbu17R). It contains:

   - `checkpoints.zip`: Unzip it and place its contents in the **root** directory:
     ```bash
     simswap_new/checkpoints/
     ```
   - `arcface_checkpoint.tar`: Copy this file into:
     ```bash
     simswap_new/arcface_model/
     ```

2. **Face Parsing Model (for postprocessing)**  
   Download from: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/154JgKpzCPW82qINcVieuPH3fZ2e0P812/view)  
   Place the `.pth` model in:
   ```bash
   simswap_new/parsing_model/checkpoint/
   ```

3. **InsightFace Models (for preprocessing)**  
   Download from: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1goH5lO8BAhTpRhpBeXqWEcGkxiiLlgx9/view)  
   Unzip contents into:
   ```bash
   simswap_new/insightface_func/models/
   ```

## 🛠️ Next Steps (Planned)

- 🔍 Add real-vs-fake classification with Xception
- 📸 Show fake image previews in the UI
- 🧪 Train per-user anti-deepfake detector
- 🗃️ Export user datasets (real + fake) in zip format
